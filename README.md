# nhl-hidescores-widget
Based on @thisisevanfox's NHL Scores widget, this addition allows the user to create a smart stack and show a spoiler-free message if they don't want live updates for one specific game.
See https://github.com/thisisevanfox/nhl-my-team-ios-widget for their widget. I did not create my widget, only modified theirs.
